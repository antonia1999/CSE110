# CSE110
Software Engineering

I had some issues in the very beginning and tried my best to fullfill the whole asignment. I had some technical difficulties with the VS Code until tday and I had more issues with VS Code UI so I did the part 3 in the main branch. 
I am an exchange student from Germany and had some troubles understanding everything, but the next time I won't have this problem and will get help from a tutor.
